Consider the following signal

    X(t) = −2sin(2πf0t) + 4cos(πf0t + φ)
    
where f0= 5 Hz, T = 2 sec, φ = π=4, fs= 100 Hz, and t = 0 : 1=fs: T .

Use MATLAB to find:

(a) Length of X

(b) Max of X

(c) Min of X

(d) Sum of X

(e) Mean of X

(f) Variance of X

(g) Values of X at t = 0:1 sec and t = 0:51 sec
