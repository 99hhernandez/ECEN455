Consider the following signal

    X(t) = exp(2πjf0t + jφ) + 2cos(2∗πf0t);

where f0= 1 Hz, T = 2 sec, φ = −π/3, fs= 100 Hz, and t = 0 : 1/fs : T 

Using MATLAB, plot the following in separate figures:

(a) Magnitude of X vs t

(b) Phase of X (in radians) vs t

(c) Real and imaginary parts of X vs t.

Please make sure that your figures are labeled. You may want to type help for plot, legend,
xlabel, ylabel and grid for assistance.
