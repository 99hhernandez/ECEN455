## Overview

This lab will be focusing on the concepts of upsampling and downsampling for discrete-time 
signals. Upsampling is the process of increasing the sampling rate of a signal, whereas  
downsampling is the process of reducing the sampling rate of a signal. By modifying a real audio 
file during the lab, you will get a hands-on experience on these concepts.

## Exercises

1) Please go to the course website and download the file “ecen455_lab1_sound.mat” in your 
matlab directory. This is an audio file of 5 seconds duration and has a sampling frequency of 48 
khz. Use the “wavplay” function in matlab to play the audio file. Plot this signal as a function of 
discrete-time.
2) Upsample this signal by a factor of 2 and play the upsampled version. Do you notice any 
differences compared to the initial signal? Plot the upsampled signal as a function of discrete-
time. Comment on the differences between the original signal and the upsampled signal.
3) Downsample this signal by a factor of 2 and play the downsampled version. Do you notice 
any differences compared to the initial signal? Plot the downsampled signal as a function of 
discrete-time. Comment on the differences between the original signal and the downsampled 
signal.
4) Downsample this signal by a factor of 12, then 24 and play the downsampled versions. Do 
you notice any differences compared to the initial signal? If you have noticed any, comment on 
why this might have happened.
