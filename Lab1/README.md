## Overview

This lab will be focusing on the concepts of upsampling and downsampling for discrete-time 
signals. Upsampling is the process of increasing the sampling rate of a signal, whereas  
downsampling is the process of reducing the sampling rate of a signal. By modifying a real audio 
file during the lab, you will get a hands-on experience on these concepts.
