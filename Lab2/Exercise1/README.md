**Birthday Problem**: This problem uses combinatorics (study of counting) for the purpose of
calculating probability. A probability class has N students enrolled. What is the probability
that at least two of the students have the same birthday? Assume that each student in the
class is equally likely to be born on any day of the year.
    
a) Plot this probablity for total number of students ranging from 1-50. If you feel the
iterations take a long time to run, reduce the total no. of iterations.
    
b) For how many students is the probability close to 0.5? Does the answer seem intuitive
to you? Explain.
    
c) Also give the mathematical expression for this probability for N students.
