**Mean and Variance of Linear Functions of Random Variables**: Generate a linear
function of two random variables of the form Z = aX + bY, where aand bare constants.
For simplicity, we assume that the random variables X and Y are binomial with p = 0.5 and
M = 10. Therefore, they can be obtained by using x=sum(rand(1,M)<p) in MATLAB. Then,
use a simulation to estimate the mean and variance of Z. Do this exercise for

a) a = 3 and b = 2

b) a = âˆ’5 and b = 7.

What do you expect the answers to be and what answers do you obtain through simulations?
How can you make both the answers tally to a precision of 2nd decimal place? Use help
command to understand more about the sum and rand functions.
