## Overview
1) This lab is designed to help students get started with the most basic MATLAB commands.
It is very important because the remainder of the labs in this course will use MATLAB.

2) Each student should write MATLAB code to complete the exercises outlined in the lab hand-
out. The TA will be there to assist you and answer questions.

3) For each lab, all students must turn in a report composed using a word processor (e.g., Word,
Powerpoint, LaTex, etc...). The report should include cover page with your name and UIN
answers. The remaining pages should contain (in order) the answers and MATLAB scripts
for the exercises. MATLAB figures can be pasted into Word and Powerpoint or saved as EPS
files for LaTex. When working on the project, please follow the instructions and respond to
each item listed. Your project grade is based on: (1) your Matlab scripts, (2) your report
(plots, explanations, etc. as required), and (3) your final results. For all labs, you must
clearly write problem number next to your solution and label the axes on all plots to get full
credit. Submission can be done electronically in PDF format or on paper.

4) MATLAB can be started by typing ”matlab” on unix workstations. Links to some MATLAB
tutorials are located on the website and you can also look at:

    You may also be able check out a copy of “The Student Edition of MATLAB User’s Guide”
or “The Matlab User’s Guide”. However, in most cases you should be able to get the ex-
planation of the functions needed for the homework by typing “help [function name]” in
the MATLAB command window. Or if you just have some idea of what you are looking for,
you may type “lookfor [keyword]”. It will list all functions related to the keyword. The
desktop version of Matlab also includes a script editor which highlights the syntax.
